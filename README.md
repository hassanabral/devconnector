# Devconnector
A social network for developers build on MERN stack. I made this web app while taking the course [MERN stack fron to back](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back).

### How to run this locally?
- ``` npm install ```
- ```npm run client-install```
- ```npm run dev```

### keys.js needs to be created in the config folder:
```
module.exports = {
   mongoURI: 'CHANGE_ME',
   secretOrKey: 'secret'
}
```
